### Phonebook in Python
This program was written for educational purposes.
Feel free to fork and learn.

There is one script:

* phonebook.py - contains only the code, no commentaries, so you can figure it out yourself

As I will progress with my studies, more features and complexity will be added.

**Road map**
1. Connect to database
2. Create a web interface
3. CI/CD

**Requirements**
* python 3.6 - f-string is used

**Notes**

    At the moment script automatically creates directories BOOKS and REMOVED in same directory where phonebook.py is executed.
